Within a year or so at [Inspectron](https://inspectrontools.com/) I worked on software for the Fluke DS703. This product really slingshotted my love for embedded system design. 
At a fundamental level, it really is impressive what a small processor can do. 
* show a live video stream
* show vibrant GUI
* implement a touchscreen
* implement real-time video transformations with minimal latency, and image artifacts.
* checkout the product to find out more

I am honored Adam enjoyed it, and it is still one of my favorite tools I have worked on at Inspectron.
