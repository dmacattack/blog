# What is a dmacattack ? 
It's me. I'm an Electrical Engineer by education, Software Engineer by profession. I've always placed myself in software near hardware to keep myself grounded (dad joke). I have over 12 years professionally writing embedded software and helping develop embedded consumer electronics. If you don't believe me, checkout my linkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-macdonald-84769770/. And if that doesnt convince you I like this stuff, I wrote my thesis in Hardware JPEG Decompression on an FPGA: https://scholar.uwindsor.ca/etd/4889/. Many of the technological advances since then make this work moot, however the experiece still adds value to my career. 

I have experience at Harman embedded software working on and calibrating AM/FM/DAB tuner software in QNX, to working with Google on the first tuner HAL. Afterwards, I refined my embedded software skills as the lead software architect at Inspectron Tools building inspectron borescopes. Most recently, my resume points to General Motors where I have worked on datacollection on QNX, Android, and have the pleasure to get working on [Eclipse UProtocol](https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol) .

# What is dmacattack telling me here ?

Fun projects I wanted to share with my light humour. I have an interest in software, electronics, 3d printing, and generally "making things".
