# What is a dmacattack ? 
It's me. I'm an Electrical Engineer by education, Software Engineer by profession. I've always placed myself in software near hardware to keep myself grounded (dad joke). I have over 12 years professionally writing embedded software and helping develop embedded consumer electronics. If you don't believe me, checkout my linkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-macdonald-84769770/. And if that doesnt convince you I like this stuff, I wrote my thesis in Hardware JPEG Decompression on an FPGA: https://scholar.uwindsor.ca/etd/4889/. Many of the technological advances since then make this work moot, however the experiece still adds value to my career. 

I have experience at Harman embedded software working on and calibrating AM/FM/DAB tuner software in QNX, to working with Google on the first tuner HAL. Afterwards, I refined my embedded software skills as the lead software architect at Inspectron Tools building inspectron borescopes. Most recently, my resume points to General Motors where I have worked on datacollection on QNX, Android, and have the pleasure to get working on [Eclipse UProtocol](https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol) .

# What is dmacattack telling me here ?

Fun projects I wanted to share. I have an interest in software, electronics, 3d printing, and generally "making things".

## MYTHBUSTERS' ADAM SAVAGE HAS USED MY SOFTWARE !

Within a year or so at [Inspectron](https://inspectrontools.com/) I worked on software for the Fluke DS703. This product really slingshotted my love for embedded system design. 
At a fundamental level, it really is impressive what a small processor can do. 
* show a live video stream
* show vibrant GUI
* implement a touchscreen
* implement real-time video transformations with minimal latency, and image artifacts.
* checkout the product to find out more

I am honored Adam enjoyed it, and it is still one of my favorite tools I have worked on at Inspectron.

## Adventures in 3d printing 001

I have been watching 3d printers since they first started to come out. Its been a long road, and I have always said to myself around the house "a 3d printer could make ___ here". I hadnt pulled the trigger until recently. After a lot of research I picked up a [BambuLabs P1S 3D printer with AMS](https://ca.store.bambulab.com/products/p1s?variant=44472890786032&currency=CAD&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw99e4BhDiARIsAISE7P_Kv9fA1Acgi9cT2C8p-PVsuhlKCAvhLSqNxhQ9y-7j0P6IxY_i7d0aAtAlEALw_wcB). This thing is amazing, BambuLabs has really focused on the hobby of 3d printing, and not the hobby of maintaining a 3d printer. Out of the box I was printing in ~30mins. They claim 15mins, but maybe I'm slow. The AMS allows for multi-color pain-free prints too ! 

The print quality is amazing, If you didnt know you were looking at a 3d print, you probably couldn't tell. The community-based app for models is also fantastic. Checkout this ghost I printed.

## Adventures in 3d printing 002

I didnt get a printer to only print other people's work, I wanted it to solve niche issues around my house and life.
